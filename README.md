# ExifRename
A simple little program I wrote to recursively rename JPGs according to information in the EXIF.

I like to have the photos I take named with the date time the photo was taken and shutter count or sequence number. You can modify the source code to change the naming scheme.

I hooked this into Windows Explorer so I can right click on a folder and rename all files in that folder tree.
